tibiapi is the fastest Tibia API made in [Python](https://www.python.org).

The tibiapi enables the complete retrieval of Tibia client information through simple [BGRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGBA_color_model) screenshots. With advanced image processing algorithms, tibiapi provides an efficient solution for accessing detailed Tibia client data, simplifying the integration of analytical features.

tibiapi code has been strategically modularized, allowing developers to use only the components necessary for their specific projects. This flexible approach not only streamlines the integration process but also optimizes resource usage, ensuring efficiency in development.

With a dedicated focus on performance optimization, tibiapi has been meticulously developed to ensure effectiveness on computers with more modest resources. This emphasis on efficiency allows developers to make the most of the tibiapi solution, regardless of hardware limitations.
