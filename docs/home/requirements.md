tibiapi has only been tested on [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10), but it is likely to work on [Windows 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11).

About support on [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), will be added soon.

## Screen resolution

For now, tibiapi only works in [1080p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p) resolution, but it will soon be adapted to any resolution.

## Hardware testing

### In which configurations was tibiapi tested?

```
# low computer
Processor: Intel® Pentium® G630
Memory: DDR3 4GB 1066mhz
```

```
# high computer
Processor: Intel® Core™ i7-9700K Processor
Memory: DDR4 16GB 3200mhz
```

### What was the response time for each one?

In a common hunt within 10 Creatures:

- low end computer will respond in 0.0006 = 600 microseconds, like 1500fps
- high end computer will respond in 0.00015 = 150 microseconds, like 6500fps

High end computer respond 4x fast then low end computer.
